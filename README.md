# Hi_Hungry_Im_Dad

## Overview

Hi_Hungry_Im_Dad is a simple web application that generates dad jokes for the user. The user is able to view the 'dad stats' as well as customise their own stats, both of which can be accessed through the homepage. The main functionality of the application allows the user to interact with the dad via a chat interface, with the dad responding with 'dad jokes' fetched from a third-party API. This project is a continuation of a hackathon I completed as part of a team in week 2 of my coding journey.

## Planning
### The MVP

The MVP for this project was very simple. I wanted to create something that would fetch dad jokes from a third party API and display them in response to the users input. For the MVP it did not matter what the user inputted as they would recieve a joke regardless, with the excpetion of the first input, in which the user would give their name. The name would then be used by the dad to adress the user. This MVP was achieved during the hackathon.

### Stretch Goals

To improve upon the app developed in the hackathon, I made some additional goals. These included:
  - Impovement of the colour palatte and to ensure it is accessible
  - introduction of multi-page navigation (e.g. a homepage)
  - The creation of wireframes to assist in design
  - Create a simple user profile that can be customised
  - Automated testing

## Design

### Colour palette

I wanted the colour palatte to reflect the fun and creative nature of the application, therefore I tried to stick to bright colours.

I selected a dark tone and two bold accent colours. Additionally, white was used to maintain suficcient contrast for some of the text.

### Wireframes

Below are the low and high fidelity wireframes for the project, created in Figma.
